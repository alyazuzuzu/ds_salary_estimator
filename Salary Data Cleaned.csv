"Square
4.1",4.1,"Data Scientist, F&S","San Francisco, CA","Company Description
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
Job Description
Square is growing its financial services footprint through the launch of new products and international expansions. This is an exciting time for our business and we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Finance and Strategy Banking team to lead analytical and strategic projects for our banking business.
This position will be fundamental in shaping our product strategy and communicating critical decisions to Product leadership, our Bank partners and to Block management. Success in this role requires the ability to exercise excellent business acumen while often operating autonomously without existing problem solving frameworks or precedent solutions. We are thus looking for someone with a strong analytical background who can manage and drive solutions across a variety of strategic and financially focused challenges.
As a Data Scientist, you will be embedded within the Square Banking Finance & Strategy team, leveraging data analytics, statistics, and predictive modeling techniques to empower data-driven decision making across our growing suite of financial products offered to Square sellers. In this role, you will collaborate closely with Business Intelligence, Finance, Product Management, Marketing and other cross-functional team members to drive recommendations that influence the direction of our Square Banking business.
Candidates can sit in any Square office in the US or be remote from any US state with the exception of Alaska.
You Will:
Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning to analyze key performance indicators
Partner with senior leaders and partners to surface analytical trends that influence business decisions across our credit and banking products
Develop data driven models to forecast the performance and growth of our products
Provide comprehensive analytics, develop tools and resources to empower data access and self-service to partner teams
Collaborate across Marketing, Capital Markets, and Business Intelligence (among other teams) to identify and understand complex relationships between key drivers of our business
Qualifications
You Have:
5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor's degree or equivalent
Fluency in SQL and familiar with a scripting language like Python
Experience exploring and understanding complex datasets and data systems, leveraging statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers, on product development and growth initiatives
Strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
Demonstrated exceptional achievement in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment
Commitment to Square's purpose of Economic Empowerment
[Bonus] An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field
[Bonus] Background with banking products, such as loans or credit/debit cards

We are building the world's largest in-home care system.
Healthcare is rapidly moving into the home, creating an enormous market opportunity that's growing daily as consumers increasingly demand more convenient healthcare options.
Technology is the engine that powers our foundation. It ensures we can reach massive scale and drives differentiation from any other healthcare company entering this space. We're using data to ensure patient safety and tailor the care to patients' specific needs which allows for better care delivery from patient onboarding, patient care, and post care follow-up.
DispatchHealth is a Series D startup with more than $400m in funding and a $1B+ valuation. We're backed by Oak, Tiger Global, Alta Partners, Optum Ventures, Questa Capital, ad EchoHealth Ventures.
Team Culture
We're a remote first org and our engineering team is spread out across the US, Mexico, and Ukraine. Our culture is focused on impact, accountability, and collaboration.
As a team, we share the goal of driving the company forward and transforming healthcare through the technology we build. We believe the only way we can accomplish our goal is together, and that our whole is greater than the sum of our parts. We collaborate closely across every function because we recognize that no individual function can solve the whole problem as well as we can when we all work together.
With our teammates spread out across different cities, we actively support each other and cultivate an environment where everyone is comfortable sharing ideas regardless of seniority or function, and where the best ideas consistently win. We know the positive feeling we get when we feel heard, and we reciprocate that deep engagement with others when they're talking or presenting so that we gain alignment and promote our collective actions.
Come join us on the journey to transform healthcare!
The Data Analytics team is responsible for powering data-driven decision making throughout tech and across the business. This team is expected to develop a deep understanding of the business, to combine that with sharp analytical and technical skills, and to ultimately drive the business forward by surfacing insights and recommendations which spark action.
Data Analysts work as part of cross-functional technical teams alongside engineers, product managers, designers, and other team members to deliver impactful technical solutions to challenging user and business problems, shape team priorities, and surface insights revealing valuable problems and opportunities. Product Analysts also work closely with Data Engineering and other teams across the business to shape how we view and observe the business – from defining and developing the metrics that matter to sculpting the key reporting tools used by executives on down to individual contributors.
Data Analysts at DispatchHealth are structured thinkers with the strategic skill to know what questions to ask, the technical skill to answer them, and the communication skill to deliver insights effectively and drive concrete action. They are curious self-starters that understand the business and strive to deepen our collective understanding over time. They leverage SQL, Python, Looker, etc to execute analyses that identify opportunities, inform product prioritization, and track performance and impact.

Effectively communicate finding to the broader team and partner with them to drive prioritization and shape product design and implementation decisions.
Identify areas of opportunity both within your product team as well as across tech and the company. Conduct deep-dive data analyses that result in high-quality insights and concrete recommendations. Determine what questions to ask, as opposed to simply answering what you're asked.
Own experiment design and impact evaluation for your product area. Work collaboratively with product teams to prioritize feature builds based on estimated impact, define goal and guardrail metrics, and interpret experiment results.
Work with tech and business leadership to define metrics that matter and data-driven decision-making frameworks. Drive broad awareness and adoption of these across the company, and strengthen our decision-making, both in terms of approach and execution, especially in high-priority focus areas.
Collaborate closely with Data Engineering and Data Science to inform data infrastructure, metric definitions, SLAs, and to generally unlock the data needed to be power reports, analyses, and high-quality decision making across the company.
Potentially serve as a mentor to more junior Product Analysts on the team, coaching individuals in terms of technical skills, analytical frameworks, experimentation setup and evaluation, or other areas. Help contribute to a culture of continuous learning within our team.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Innate curiosity, business sense, and bias to impact

Description
Tennessee (TN) demonstrates some of the highest rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the nation, and rates are on the rise. Driven by the opioid epidemic, the highest rates of HCV are among people who inject drugs, and specifically among people less than 40 years of age and living in rural areas. The purpose of this project is to enhance existing infrastructure to identify, engage, and refer individuals at high risk for bloodborne infections related to drug use, who would otherwise likely not have the support, resources, and/or ability to access needed services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded one-time federal funds to the TN Department of Health to address this crisis, and this is a contract position funded through December 31, 2023 with possible extension.
This nursing position will serve as one of the Harm Reduction Resource Team Nurses (HRRTs). This nursing position will identify, engage, and refer at-risk individuals to prevention and treatment services, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunizations, family planning, substance use disorder treatment, mental health services, syringe services programs, etc. Priority populations will include: 1) individuals tested for HCV in a TN local health department clinic and without evidence of current HCV infection (i.e., HCV Ab negative) but identified as a person who uses drugs (PWUD) or with a history of incarceration or 2) individuals testing HCV Ab positive/RNA negative.
This position could also be asked to provide surge capacity for community engagement/outreach (e.g., county jails, harm reduction coalitions) and during HIV or HCV cluster response, including: a) conducting enhanced risk factor assessments among persons identified as part of a HIV or HCV transmission cluster of significance; and b) supporting targeted prevention and linkage to care outreach activities
This nursing position will document all contact attempts and education/referrals provided in a project-specific database. This position is expected to participate in calls and meetings with project manager, Central Office HIV/HCV cluster response team, local DIS, epidemiologists, and/or clinical staff as requested. Further, this nursing position will coordinate with existing Viral Hepatitis Case Navigators (VHCNs) and the project manager to create/update regional provider directories, with an emphasis on services for PWUD, and hopefully will serve on-site at local community based organizations (CBOs) to provide phlebotomy for HCV testing and education related to viral hepatitis.
This nursing position will primarily serve East Tennessee and Knoxville-Knox County Public Health Regions. Regions can be viewed at the following link: https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/localdepartments.html

About the Department
The Health Lab’s mission is to partner with civic and community leaders to identify, rigorously evaluate and scale programs and policies that improve health outcomes and address systemic barriers to achieving health equity. To accomplish our mission, we seek to identify and engage groups of people who are disproportionally impacted by health disparities that result from socioeconomic disadvantage and systemic inequities, and to develop and evaluate interventions that improve health, safety, and vitality and reduce health and social disparities. Decades of experience have proven that health care alone cannot solve urban health problems, or address related cross-sectoral challenges in poverty, crime, education and the environment faced by many urban residents. Accordingly, we work closely with diverse partners, including persons and communities with lived experience of disadvantage in urban contexts, to learn directly from them about the challenges they face interacting with the health care system and social service sectors. We seek to partner with these groups and the organizations committed to serving them to develop and evaluate interventions to address these challenges. We support our partners using data-driven findings and are deeply committed to expanding knowledge about the effectiveness of policies, programs and interventions to promote health equity. We believe that generating evidence on multi-sectoral interventions can have a multiplicative impact, improving not just health but also equity and outcomes across other sectors. Our partners in these efforts include communities and community-based organizations, medical and social service providers, housing and homeless services providers, emergency service providers, and members of the corrections, policing and other law enforcement communities. These relationships are essential to advance our mission. As with the other Urban Labs, our approach applies science in the service of cities. We hypothesize that two key obstacles prevent cities from mobilizing and coordinating their resources across sectors. First, cities lack evidence about the multi-sector impact of their efforts. Second, cities lack sufficient coordination mechanisms and incentives to collaborate across sectors to improve health equity. Based on these hypotheses, the Health Lab focuses our resources on generating high-quality evidence about interventions that can be widely scaled to sustainably improve urban health. For examples of our work, please see: http://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/
Job Summary
The University of Chicago Health Lab is seeking a Data Scientist to work on our portfolio of projects applying machine learning to public policy, particularly in the area of improving 911 and emergency response.
